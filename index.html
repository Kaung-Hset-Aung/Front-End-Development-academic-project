      <h2 id="pollution">Pollution and its Impacts</h2>
      <p>Pollution has become a <strong> global problem</strong> as all living organisms, from unicellular
         microbes to the largest blue whales, including men, have to depend on Earth's supply of
         air, water, soil and minerals for their survival.
      </p>
      <p>When these resources had come to
         pollution, all form of life becomes threatened and many environmental organizations
         are starting to focus on building a cleaner and greener environment together with the
         government. Apart from government's effort and organizational programs, individual
         cooperation of every citizen as a part is also of high significance.

         Adopting sustainable practices and embracing a mindset that values 
         environmental stewardship is no longer a choice; it is a responsibility we owe to ourselves
         and to our future generations.Simply, pollutions are signs and symptoms of
         mother earth's sickness and are urgently demanding humanity to give effective attention on building a
         clean and green community.
      </p>
      <p>
         There is a countless number of buildings in a city and none of them is built up with one single brick.
         The taller the building measures, the more the amount of bricks constitute, such
         that the larger clean and green community we desire to build, the bigger network of
         cooperative participants we demand.
      </p>
      <h2 id="role">Role of initiative youths</h2>
      <p>The role of initiative youths here is to promote the
         interest of people on our green projects and convince them for their cooperation. In order to
         accomplish our aim, we have to educate our community about the nature of pollutions
         that our environment has been suffering from, and let them aware that the chief
         causes of pollution were brought about by the population itself as a result of excessive and
         erroneous use of natural resources.
      </p>
      <p>We should suggest a general idea about some dos and don'ts towards our community,
         that one may finally realize how sustainable use of natural resources will ameliorate pollutions,
         how each individual could cooperate, and why their cooperation is important in creating a cleaner and
         greener community. As a result, the amount of unnecessary waste of resources will
         be greatly reduced and the process of sustaining will come as a successful outcome.
